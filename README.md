# pop-cosmos-prior

This is a repository containing utilities for working with the pop-cosmos galaxy population model. The pop-cosmos model was first introduced and trained by [Alsing et al. (2024)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.00935). The use of this population model as a prior in SED fitting is described in [Thorp et al. (2024)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19437).
